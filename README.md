# SoccerFixtureApp

This project is a football-related iOS application that displays fixtures and competitions using the **MVVM** architecture and the **Combine** framework. It provides an intuitive UI with multiple tabs and segmented navigation.

## Features

### **Main Tabs**
- **Fixtures Tab**: Displays today's football fixtures.
- **Competitions Tab**: Lists all available competitions.

2. **Fixtures**: Shows upcoming and past matches in the competition.
3. **Teams**: Lists all participating teams along with their crests.
